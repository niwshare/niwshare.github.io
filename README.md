# Example of the I-140 petition for EB2-NIW

When I was preparing my NIW petition, I cannot find any real petition. Although Andrey Solovyev's webpage provides an example petition, it is actually modified from his EB1A petition nearly two decades ago. The structure and content are actually, from my understanding, not suitable for today's requirments.

As my background is pretty unique and I don't think highly templated petition drafted by lawyers would capture the nuance of my background and my research, I DIY'd my petition. I submitted my petition through USCIS'S online portal with a priority date of Dec 05, 2025, upgraded my case to premium processing with a receipt date of Dec 15, 2025, and finally got the approval email on Feb 10, 2026.

So, I'd like to share my NIW petition as many users on Reddit asked for it. I anonymized most of the personal information such as degree, university, company, etc, as well as a few sentences about my work or research details that might be identifiable. I also removed most exhibits of evidence related to me but kept government policies, academic articles, and other documents I cited in my petition, in case other people would also like to cite them.
