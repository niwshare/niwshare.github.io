# NIW

When I was preparing my NIW petition, I cannot find any real petition. Although [Andrey Solovyev's webpage](https://andreychemist.github.io/) provides an example petition, it is actually modified from his EB1A petition nearly two decades ago. The structure and content are actually, from my understanding, not suitable for today's requirments.
